- Supervised learning: Models trained on labeled data to perform regression or classification tasks. Strengths: direct mapping from input to known output; common in many applied ML problems.

- Unsupervised learning: Models trained on unlabeled data to discover structure (e.g., clustering). Good for exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection, and feature learning.

- Reinforcement learning: Agents learn by trial-and-error in an environment using rewards/penalties. Suited to sequential decision-making problems (games, robotics, control).

- Generative AI: Models that produce content (text, images, audio, video) from inputs. Includes transformer-based LLMs, diffusion models, GANs, and VAEs; described by input→output types.

Quick keywords: labeled data, regression, classification, clustering, rewards, policy, generative, diffusion, transformers.
