## Types of ML Systems

### Supervised learning

- Supervised learning models learn to make predictions from labeled data (examples paired with the correct answers).
- A human provides training data that includes the desired output, and the model discovers relationships that map inputs to those outputs.
- Common supervised tasks:
  - Regression — predict a numeric value (e.g., house price).
  - Binary classification — predict one of two classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
  - Multiclass classification — predict one of more than two classes (e.g., digit recognition).

### Unsupervised learning

- Unsupervised learning models find patterns in data without labeled outcomes.
- A common technique is clustering, where the algorithm groups similar data points together.
- Key difference from classification: cluster categories are discovered by the algorithm rather than pre-defined.

### Reinforcement learning

- Reinforcement learning (RL) learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
- The agent learns a policy that maps states to actions to maximize cumulative reward.

### Generative AI

- Generative AI refers to models that create new content from input prompts.
- Inputs and outputs can vary (text → text, text → image, image → text, audio → audio, etc.).
- Often described as "input-type → output-type" (for instance, text-to-image).

## Suggested next edits

- Add examples and simple code snippets for each section (e.g., a tiny sklearn regression snippet).
- Expand "Generative AI" with model types (GANs, VAEs, autoregressive transformers) and use-cases.
- Add links to recommended readings or course references.
